Remember

Question: List the main characteristics of a eukaryotic cell. Answer:

    Defined nucleus enclosed by a nuclear envelope.
    Presence of membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.
    Larger size compared to prokaryotic cells.
    Complex cytoskeletal structure.

Understand

Question: Explain the difference between a eukaryotic cell and a prokaryotic cell. Answer:

    Eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus containing the cellâ€™s DNA, whereas prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; their DNA floats freely in the cell.
    Eukaryotes have complex organelles including mitochondria, whereas prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles.


Apply

Question: How would you classify different types of cells based on their organelles? Answer:

    Muscle Cells: Contain numerous mitochondria for energy during contraction.
    Nerve Cells: Extensive network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum for neurotransmitter production.
    Plant Cells: Have chloroplasts for photosynthesis and large vacuoles for storage.


Analyze

Question: Compare the structure of a plant cell and an animal cell. Answer:

    Plant cells have a cell wall for structure and rigidity, animal cells do not.
    Plant cells contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, animal cells lack chloroplasts.
    Animal cells have centrioles, which are typically absent in plant cells.

Evaluate

Question: Judge the importance of cell specialization in multicellular organisms. Answer:

    Cell specialization allows multicellular organisms to be more efficient as different cells perform different functions, leading to higher overall functionality and survival.

Create

Question: Develop a model illustrating the functions of different organelles within a eukaryotic cell. Answer:

    No response given. (Student 1 struggles with creation tasks.
